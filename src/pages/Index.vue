        We are a small family run nursery based in Kitchener, Ontario that has a
        huge passion for growing fruiting plants. Our plants range from rare
        exotics from South America to permaculture inspired plants that
        fertilize your soil.<br /><br />

        Importing rare fruit from a southern climate to Canada is expensive,
        impractical, and often not even possible. If you desire rare foreign
        fruit that is seldom seen in Canada, your best option may be to grow the
        fruiting plants themselves. Here we provide some rare exotic fruiting
        plants that can be grown in pots and cared for in your own home.<br /><br />

        For fruiting plants that can be grown outside, we sell many permaculture
        inspired plants that can be grown depending on your plant hardiness
        zone. Many of these plants produce edible fruit, are nitrogen fixers, or
        just rare to find. Permaculture gardening is a great and ecological way
        to create a year-round feast on your property. Please consider using
        this approach if it is new to you.<br /><br />

        ***Due to unprecedented demand, we are out as of June 2020 of most of
        our listed plants but we should have many back in stock by July/ August
        2021. We will be adding more plant varieties in late Summer, so please
        check back to view our new plants. ** Please Note that we have a number
        of fig varieties that are not in our website, but are available by
        email: Italian Black, Black Jack, Petite Negri, Paradiso, LSU Gold,
        Flanders, Nazareth, Armenian, LSU Everbearing, Celeste, Ronde de
        Bordeaux, Early Violet and Bayernfeige Violetta.** Go to our Contact Us
        page to inquire.**
